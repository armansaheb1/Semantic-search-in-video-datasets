So the Cyrus does have another son. The other son is called Bardia.", "starttime": "5.43", "endtime": "5.52"}, {"sentence": "So let me write this down. So there is another son called Bardia. And then there's this other character known as Darious.", "starttime": "5.52", "endtime": "6.1"}, {"sentence": "Soon to be known as Darious the Great. And Darious is not a direct descendant of Cyrus the Great, but he is part of his family.", "starttime": "6.1", "endtime": "6.11"}, {"sentence": "He's a distant relative. He is part of the Achaemenid dynasty, a part of, he claims descendant from Achaemenis. And he was the Lance bearer for Cambases the Second.", "starttime": "6.11", "endtime": "6.22"}, {"sentence": "So while Cambases is out here in Egypt, leaving that power vacuum, someone who claims to be Bardia takes control of the empire or is trying to take control of the empire.", "starttime": "6.22", "endtime": "6.38"}, {"sentence": "Now some accounts say that this is really Bardia. This is really the other son of Cyrus the Great. And so there would be some legitimate claim to the throne. But there's other claims, especially the ones that Darious was later able to spread, that no, this was not the real Bardia.", "starttime": "6.38", "endtime": "6.54"}, {"sentence": "This was a fake Bardia, that the real Bardia had actually been killed by Cambases the Second before. And that this person proposing to be Bardia was this fake usurper, this Zoraastrian priest named Gamatha.", "starttime": "6.54", "endtime": "7.6"}, {"sentence": "And once Cambases on his way, he's trying to come back in order to reclaim the throne or in order to get rid of this usurper, whether it was the real Bardia or not.", "starttime": "7.6", "endtime": "7.17"}, {"sentence": "But on the way he dies, and once he gets under dubious circumstances, Cyrus the Great, how he died, not clear, Cambases the Second also dies under dubious circumstances. And then this Bardia is actually becomes the Shah in Shah for real.", "starttime": "7.17", "endtime": "7.29"}, {"sentence": "He's obviously has claims to it while Cambases is there. But once Cambases dies, he is the Shah in Shah. Well Darious doesn't like this. He has his own imperial ambitions. He gets some other nobility together and says, no, no, no, this Bardia isn't the real Bardia.", "starttime": "7.29", "endtime": "7.44"}, {"sentence": "He's a usurper. Let's go kill that guy. And so they kill him. And then it's an interesting story. Herodidus has a fairly dubious account of how Darious was able to convince the other noble people why he should be the Shah in Shah the Emperor.", "starttime": "7.44", "endtime": "7.59"}, {"sentence": "But they are able to get rid of Bardia. We still do not know whether it was the real Bardia or whether it was the fake Bardia. But then Darious takes power in 522 BCE.", "starttime": "7.59", "endtime": "8.12"}, {"sentence": "And he's known as Darious the Great because he continues to spread, he continues to conquer more and more for the Persian Empire. And this map right over here, this is the Persian Empire in 500 BCE, under Darious the Great.", "starttime": "8.12", "endtime": "8.28"}, {"sentence": "It's near that it's maximum extent. And it's a pretty incredible empire. It's worth noting. And it's big by any stretch of the imagination. But it's at this time the population is on the order of 50 million people.", "starttime": "8.28", "endtime": "8.42"}, {"sentence": "And based on the accounts that I've seen, that's almost half of the world population at that time. No empire in history as far as we can tell has ever had such a large fraction of the world's population under its control.", "starttime": "8.42", "endtime": "8.54"}, {"sentence": "And so that gives you a sense of how great or how large an empire this was. Now Darious the Great, he is also famous, especially from a Greek perspective, for going after the Greeks.", "starttime": "8.54", "endtime": "9.7"}, {"sentence": "You had these Greek revolts in these towns on the west coast of the Anatolian Peninsula. They revolted against their Persian overlords. I guess you could say. And they did that with the help of the Athenians.", "starttime": "9.7", "endtime": "9.20"}, {"sentence": "And so Darious didn't like this. In the 490s, he starts going after the Athenians. This is the beginning of the Greco-Persian Wars. He is unsuccessful. He dies in the 480s. And then his son, this is actually a relief of Darious the Great right over here from Persepolis.", "starttime": "9.20", "endtime": "9.40"}, {"sentence": "And then his son continues to try to take over. And the second Greco-Persian Wars. And he too is unsuccessful. But it's worth noting. A lot of this history that we get, especially of Cyrus the Great and the early Persian, Shanshaas, the history we get is from the Greeks.", "starttime": "9.40", "endtime": "9.57"}, {"sentence": "So it's worth taking it with a great grain of salt because as you can see, they were rivals. And to say rivals is a little bit unfair to the Persians because the Greeks were more of a thorn in the side, thorn in the side of a large empire. The Greeks were this group of city states. They weren't even a unified empire.", "starttime": "9.57", "endtime": "10.14"}, {"sentence": "While you had here the Persian Empire controls almost half of the world's population. So the Greeks were more of a thorn in the side. But we get our history from them. Or a lot of our history from them. So we get their account of things.", "starttime": "10.14", "endtime": "10.28"}, {"sentence": "Now once you have zerces, then after zerces you have art zerces right here over here. And then you have a little bit of a squabble for the throne. And then Darious the Second. There's one thing that you see over the over 200 years of a cheminate rule is that most people after Darious the Great are named either zerces, art zerces, Darious the Second, Third, or at least not fourth.", "starttime": "10.28", "endtime": "10.54"}, {"sentence": "Art zerces, art zerces, Second, art zerces, Third. So again a little confusing. But the reason why I even did this for myself to see when all of these people lived and when they ruled is to have a good sense of what was going on. And how Darious the Second, how lived at a different time than for example Darious the First or Darious the Great.", "starttime": "10.54", "endtime": "11.14"}, {"sentence": "The other thing worth mentioning because you'll hear this in various history classes when you talk about the Persian Empire is the great cities of the Persian Empire.", "starttime": "11.14", "endtime": "11.24"}, {"sentence": "Asyrs the Great he establishes the capital at Pissargadi right over here. You have Cambases establishes a capital at Susa. Susa is one end of the great royal highway that goes from Sardis all the way to Susa right over there.", "starttime": "11.24", "endtime": "11.41"}, {"sentence": "You have Darious the Great establishes a capital at Persepolis. And that's the Greek name for it literally referring to Persian city and this is a relief from Persepolis right over here.", "starttime": "11.41", "endtime": "11.53"}, {"sentence": "Now the end of the Akimid dynasty comes when that famous thorn in the side Greece actually unifies under Philip of Macedon. And here we're talking about the mid to the mid to early to mid 4th century BCE.", "starttime": "11.53", "endtime": "12.11"}, {"sentence": "And his son Alexander becomes this great conqueror. Alexander the Great and he's able to conquer the entire Persian Empire famously taking it away from Darious the Third. We talk about that in another video or in several videos in some detail.", "starttime": "12.11", "endtime": "12.25"}, {"sentence": "But Alexander the Great he has this vision of a one nation of these people kind of their cultures mixing together and there's a significant amount of cultural mix between the Greeks and the Persians.", "starttime": "12.25", "endtime": "12.36"}, {"sentence": "But then Alexander dies and his empire split but the most of the Persian Empire goes to under the control of Celicus who is one of Alexander's generals and then you have the Solucid Empire which is really foreign rule of Persia.", "starttime": "12.36", "endtime": "12.52"}, {"sentence": "And that will continue for a while until eventually the Parthians which is once again another state or region of the Persian Empire takes control to establish the Parthian Empire which is one of the rivals to Rome.", "starttime": "12.52", "endtime": "13.6"}, {"sentence": "That's worth mentioning and I mentioned this in the video on ancient Persia that under Persian rule and Cyrus and the very Shansha's who are famous for delegating their authority. When you have such a large empire you can't control all of it yourself.", "starttime": "13.6", "endtime": "13.18"}, {"sentence": "So each of these regions had their own I guess you could say governors and those governors were called satraps and the regions were called satrapies.", "starttime": "13.18", "endtime": "13.26"}, {"sentence": "Anyway I will leave you there. I will the other thing that Cyrus the Great is really known for is the spread of the Zoroastrian faith. We talk about the Zoroastrian faith in other videos.", "starttime": "13.26", "endtime": "13.36"}, {"sentence": "And Zara Thustra who was the kind of the prophet of the Zoroastrian faith. He lived some place between 1500 BCE and might have even lived shortly right before almost near the time of science the Great but it was really science the Great who helps spread this great ancient faith.", "starttime": "13.36", "endtime": "13.52"}]}
