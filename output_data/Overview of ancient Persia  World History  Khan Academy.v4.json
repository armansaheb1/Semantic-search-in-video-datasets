So there's based on my research ideas like Arianum Veja and Iran Shah and Iran.", "starttime": "1.11", "endtime": "1.25"}, {"sentence": "So it actually turns out that the modern, the name of the country, the modern word Iran is probably more appropriate or in some ways closer to what the region has always called itself, what the Iranians or the Persians.", "starttime": "1.25", "endtime": "1.40"}, {"sentence": "They have always called themselves and called where they lived. They referred to themselves as the Aryans and where they lived as the Arianum Veja or Iran or Iran Shah or some version of that in the modern version is Iran.", "starttime": "1.40", "endtime": "1.58"}, {"sentence": "Now with that said, you might say, well, why did the Greeks call it Persia? Well, the Persian Empire, what we consider to be the first true Persian Empire, is the Achaemenid Empire.", "starttime": "1.59", "endtime": "2.11"}, {"sentence": "And we'll talk in a second why do we call it even the Achaemenid, but the Achaemenid Empire emerges from a region of Persia, I guess we can say, that in this map is referred to as Persis, but other names for it are Pars.", "starttime": "2.11", "endtime": "2.27"}, {"sentence": "And even in modern Iran, there is a region called Fars, which coincides very close with it.", "starttime": "2.27", "endtime": "2.33"}, {"sentence": "And since the leaders of the Persian Empire, and it especially sires the great, emerge from this region, they called them the Persians.", "starttime": "2.33", "endtime": "2.45"}, {"sentence": "And it was the Persian Empire that emerges from this region, what you might want to call Pars, Fars, Fars, especially comes from Arabic, where they don't have the P sound, but Pars or Persis or whatever you want to call it.", "starttime": "2.45", "endtime": "3.1"}, {"sentence": "And that's why it was called the Persian Empire.", "starttime": "3.1", "endtime": "3.4"}, {"sentence": "Now, it wasn't the first empire in that region, before the Persian Empire gets established, or what we associate with the Persian or the Achaemenid Empire of sires the great, much of this region of where we call modern day around was controlled by the medians.", "starttime": "3.5", "endtime": "3.21"}, {"sentence": "And you can see media is this region right over here.", "starttime": "3.21", "endtime": "3.26"}, {"sentence": "And it was sires the great, that in 549, some accounts say 550 BCE, is able to overthrow the median emperor, who happens to be his grandfather.", "starttime": "3.26", "endtime": "3.39"}, {"sentence": "And that is the real dawn of the Achaemenid dynasty.", "starttime": "3.39", "endtime": "3.44"}, {"sentence": "Now, the next question, and this was established, let me write this down, this is established by sires the great.", "starttime": "3.44", "endtime": "3.50"}, {"sentence": "Sires the great, he was sires the second, but he became sires the great, because he's able to break out and overthrow the medians and establish this massive empire.", "starttime": "3.50", "endtime": "4.1"}, {"sentence": "And the reason why it's called the Achaemenid Empire, not the sired empire, is that sires claims, to be from the family of the patriarch Achaemenis.", "starttime": "4.1", "endtime": "4.15"}, {"sentence": "And a lot of these names, these are from Greek accounts, and so that's why they sound a little bit more Greek.", "starttime": "4.15", "endtime": "4.21"}, {"sentence": "But Achaemenis is a semi-legendary figure, that we're not sure exactly when he lived, but the best accounts I could see is near the beginning of the 7th century BCE.", "starttime": "4.21", "endtime": "4.34"}, {"sentence": "And sires the great is from Achaemenis family.", "starttime": "4.34", "endtime":

don't tend to refer to the Median Empire, they're really referring to the Achaemenid Empire.", "starttime": "4.44", "endtime": "4.49"}, {"sentence": "That's why it's called Achaemenid.", "starttime": "4.49", "endtime": "4.51"}, {"sentence": "Now in future videos we'll talk more about what happened in the Achaemenid Empire, but you can see the extent of it was pretty significant.", "starttime": "4.51", "endtime": "5.0"}, {"sentence": "And it lasts for a little over 200 years, until they are conquered by foreigners.", "starttime": "5.0", "endtime": "5.6"}, {"sentence": "And the foreigners that conquer them are the Greeks.", "starttime": "5.6", "endtime": "5.8"}, {"sentence": "The Philip of Macedon's son, Alexander the Great, is able to, on some level, unify Greece and Persia.", "starttime": "5.9", "endtime": "5.16"}, {"sentence": "And it's interesting because a lot of what we learn about ancient Persia, it's accounts from the Greeks, from folks like Herodidus.", "starttime": "5.16", "endtime": "5.23"}, {"sentence": "But during the time of classical Greeks, Greece was really a bit of a side show.", "starttime": "5.23", "endtime": "5.29"}, {"sentence": "It was really this kind of porn in the side of Persia.", "starttime": "5.29", "endtime": "5.32"}, {"sentence": "Persia was really where the power was.", "starttime": "5.32", "endtime": "5.35"}, {"sentence": "But as we get to the mid or the end of the 4th century BCE, Persia Weekens, Greece unifies under Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great.", "starttime": "5.35", "endtime": "5.47"}, {"sentence": "And Alexander the Great is able to conquer the Persian Empire.", "starttime": "5.47", "endtime": "5.51"}, {"sentence": "And he is short lived, we have videos on Alexander the Great, I encourage you to watch them.",

mixing the cultures and really being a unified people.", "starttime": "5.59", "endtime": "6.3"}, {"sentence": "But as soon as he dies, his empire splits.", "starttime": "6.4", "endtime": "6.6"}, {"sentence": "But the Persian empire, for the most part, is in the control of the Solucids.", "starttime": "6.6", "endtime": "6.12"}, {"sentence": "And the Solucid Dynasty, this is essentially foreign rule.", "starttime": "6.12", "endtime": "6.16"}, {"sentence": "Because Soluca, who established the Solucid Dynasty, he is one of Alexander's generals.", "starttime": "6.16", "endtime": "6.21"},

{"sentence": "And you don't get back to having Persian rule until 238 BCE.", "starttime": "6.26", "endtime": "6.32"}, {"sentence": "And so in 238 BCE, the Parthians emerge to conquer the empire.",

important to keep in mind.", "starttime": "6.44", "endtime": "6.46"}, {"sentence": "Because in its day, the Okiminid Empire was, if not the dominant, one of the very dominant empires of the world.", "starttime": "6.46", "endtime": "6.54"}, {"sentence": "At its peak, it had a population.", "starttime": "6.54", "endtime": "6.57"}, {"sentence": "And this is roughly under Darius the Great.",

its peak had approximately 50 million people.", "starttime": "7.3", "endtime": "7.8"}, {"sentence": "And that's a lot of people at any time in history.", "starttime": "7.9", "endtime": "7.11"}, {"sentence": "But especially at that time in history.", "starttime": "7.11", "endtime": "7.13"}, {"sentence": "Because at that time in history, there was only a little over 100 million people",

we can tell.", "starttime": "7.23", "endtime": "7.28"}, {"sentence": "So that gives it some claim to being maybe the greatest or one of the greatest empires in world history.", "starttime": "7.28",

about the glory of the Roman Empire.", "starttime": "7.39", "endtime": "7.42"}, {"sentence": "But the Parthians were right there beside of them.", "starttime": "7.42", "endtime": "7.45"}, {"sentence":

Empire.", "starttime": "7.51", "endtime": "7.55"}, {"sentence": "And they gave each other space and they went back and forth, especially around the Middle East.", "starttime": "7.55", "endtime": "7.59"}, {"sentence": "And you have this empire from the Parthians, you go to the Sassanians.", "starttime": "8.0", "endtime": "8.4"}, {"sentence": "And eventually in the 7th century CE, you have the Islam comes into the Persian Empire and becomes the dominant religion.", "starttime": "8.4", "endtime": "8.13"}, {"sentence": "And so that might make you ask, well what was the dominant religion

{"sentence": "Some people say it might be even right before, even coincident with the life of Sires the Great.", "starttime": "8.46", "endtime": "8.52"}, {"sentence": "So there's some debate on when
